## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


The Badge Tracker project is an open-source application which provides Girl Guide and other non-profit volunteer leaders the ability to efficiently store and update badge progress. Our goal is to streamline the administrative side of how youth groups record and maintain badges and badge progress to save time and to ensure the badges are delivered swiftly.

For detailed instructions on how to run the application, please visit [our code repository](https://github.com/Badge-Tracker/BadgeTracker "Badge Tracker Repository").
